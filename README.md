Hash Map Portfolio Assignment for CS 261 (Data Structures) at Oregon State University. 

This assignment creates a hash map program from scratch, then uses the hash map to implement a word count program. 

The word_count.py program takes an input document, computes the number of times each word was used in the document, and returns the top X words and associated counts.
